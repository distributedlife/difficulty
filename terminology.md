### Terminology
There are few words that will get used over and over again in this work. Difficulty, skills, vector and spectrum. I'm going to take moment now to define these forIn the context of this book, I will use the term trait to refer to a trait is a distinguishing quality or characteristic; a genetically determined characteristic. I use within the work.

> Skill - a discrete, named, thing that you need to succeed at a given game.

In this book, I use the term skill to refer to the discrete thing that makes one person succeed in a give games word instead of characteristic because it takes less time to type out.

skillit is what makes one person better at a game than another. *Strength*, for example, is a *physical* skill trait. You can be stronger than someone else and this influences how good you are at games where strength is the deciding factor e.g. weightlifting.

Skills have been organised into four related groups: *physical*, *mental*, *social* and *external*. Physical skilltraits are to do with your physical body and include the aforementioneds strength. Mental skilltraits relate to how you think and include skilltraits like memory and prediction. Social skilltraits involve working with or against other people and includes collaboration and negotiation. The final group: external skilltraits refers to the influence on the game from things outside the game. This group includes luck, time and money.

Physical skilltraits are, to an extent, governed by our genetics and the environment that we grew up in. Both your nutrition and the genetics of your parents will influence how tall you will be. Once you've grown to a certain height you can't grow any more. 

This doesn’t mean that physical skilltraits cannot be improved. All athletes work very hard to become as good as they are.  All this means that when you’re designing a game that relies on these skillraits you need to consider how this influences which players are going to winwill be better. 

It also means that in order for one player to become better at a game, they need to put in training to become stronger, or faster or more coordinated. Those who can'tdon’t have the inclination or the time to do this will be less likelydisinclined to play your game.

This is the goal of this book. To help you identify who will be good at your game and to help you tailor the game for those players. Or, if you want to design your game for people you don’t normally design games for.

## Vector
Now that we have this concept of broad skills we're going to want to tune that skill for our game. This is where vectors come into play. Vectors allow us to make a game easier or harder and allow us to make that progression happen over the course of the game.

One of the skills we will discuss in this work is *memory*; the player's ability to remember important information. At some point in the game we may show the player a four digit code. Then later the player will have to recall those four digits. We can make this game of memory easier or harder by playing with these **vectors**:

- *age* - the time between when the player last saw the data and when they have to recall it. Lengthen this interval to make the game harder or shorten it to make it easier.
- *size* - how much information the player must remember. A single digit is far easier than 20 numbers.
- *noise* - how much other information is present at the time of memorisation or recall distracts the player from the numbers required. When the four digit number is shown we can show a different set of similar numbers at the same time, some of which may be more prominent. We can then continue to reference other numbers that do not need to be remembered during the interval. Finally during recall a flashing sequence of unrelated numbers should continue to tax our poor player.

There are other vectors related to memory but I'll save them for when we talk about memory in full.

These three things are difficulty vectors. You have a game that requires a set of skills. With each vector you can tweak it for easier modes or progression from start to finish.

> Vector - An aspect of skill that allows us to make a game easier or harder.

Each skill included in this work will have multiple vectors you can use to tweak the difficulty. There is also an appendix that contains each difficulty vector.

#### Spectrum
Each of our vectors allow games to be made easier or harder. This changing of the vector is a change of where it sits on the spectrum.

Using the example of the **size** vector for the *memory* skill. We know that not having to remember any information is the easiest so that sits on one extreme edge. After that only one piece of information is next easiest. As we add more things to remember, we move away from easy towards the hard end. 

	EASIER | 0 <--> 1 <--> 4 <--> 20 <--> ... | HARDER

There is no upper limit here, we can keep adding more things for the player to remember all at once.

The **age** vector would sit on this spectrum. From visible where the thing we remember is visible while we are remembering it through to something we saw a few months ago.

	EASIER | Visible <--> Recently <--> Some time ago <--> Never Seen | HARDER

With spectrums we don't define all the points in between we just know that they exist and that you can make a game harder by shifting it along the spectrum.

#### Difficulty
Not all games require the same involvement of skill. In some games it's *vital* that a player have a particular skill. In other it's *relevant* but isn't the differentiating factor. Adding to this is *irrelevant* where skills don't matter for games. Unless the pieces are really heavy, *strength* doesn’t make you a better Chess player.

These are again points on a spectrum with *irrelevant* on one end and *vital* on the other. 

	| Irrelevant <——> Relevant <——> Vital |

In this book I’ll dive deep into each trait and come up with what I called *difficulty vectors*. These are ways ing won’t help you in a sprinting race. 

##### Relevant
The skill is involved in the play of the game and does impact the game. But it itself is not enough to win consistently. Luck is involved in poker and it may help you win a game. But you can’t rely on luck alone to be competitive.

##### Vital
The skill either by itself, or with another skill directly determines the outcome of the game. Being the fastest will help you win the sprint.


### Games
Throughout this book I use the term table-top games to refer to all card and board games. I include role playing games (RPG) in this too. The second category is computer games which is any game that is at primarily electronic. The third and final category is physical. This last game is any game that is physical in nature. Track & Field, Cricket and live action role playing games (LARP) all sit in this category. 

The important thing is that that they are all games.

##### Table-Top Games
International Chess, Poker, Dungeons & Dragons, Diplomacy, Charades and Sunshine City.

##### Computer Games
Doom, Zork, Plants vs. Zombies, Star Craft, Proteus and Starseed Pilgrim.

##### Physical Games
100m Sprint, Jogging, Cricket, Soccer and Skiing.hich you can make a game harder or easier.
