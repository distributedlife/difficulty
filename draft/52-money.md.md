Let’s play a game of monopoly, except at the start of the game each player is allowed to buy any tiles based on how much money they have in their bank account. A rich person will like this game as they might be able to own every location making it basically impossible for another player to win. Welcome to the real world. It sucks doesn’t it.

But we don’t need to let the real world enter into the game. Some games do though and this makes the game more difficult for those who don’t have money.

Difficulty Vectors
Money - The more money you have the easier the game is.

Example Games
Irrelevant
International Chess - Having more money won’t help you win the game.
