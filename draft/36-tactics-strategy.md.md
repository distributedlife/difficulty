Strategy is our longer term plan. Tactics are opportunistic short term decisions that can go directly against our strategy. A tactical bombing is one that achieves an immediate value in the war. A strategic bombing is one that tries to debilitate the enemies ability to wage war[ cite this].

In a game that allows multiple victory conditions, then choosing one of these is a strategy. In games with only one victory condition coming up with how you achieve victory is your strategy. It might be “buy every house you land on” in Monopoly.

Strategy: gaining a competitive advantage by making better strategic decisions than your opponents.

Pure abstract strategy is a decision tree. There is no chance and no hidden element. This is chess. When you add chance you get Backgammon, when you add the hidden element then you get Stratego.


Difficulty Vectors
Paths - Having more paths to victory makes it harder to pick the one that will get you there before any other players.

Complexity - Pure abstract strategy is a decision tree. You can work out all the moves in advance if you have the computing power. You can make this harder to do by making the number of potential moves very large. Checkers used to have this but it’s possible for a computer to work it all out. Chess and Go still have this. 

Hidden Element - If you make some information in the game invisible then it becomes harder to compute the best move.

Chance - If you make some elements of the game random then it becomes impossible to permute the perfect course.

Example Games
Irrelevant
Sprinting - There is no strategy required in this game.

Relevant
Poker - Putting someone ‘on-tilt’ in order to upset their strategy.

Vital
Civilisation - There are multiple ways for a player to win the game. Each of these different ways is a strategy.

Chess - Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play[ cite]. A tactical decision in chess is one where you have the choice between: making a gain at the cost of your existing strategy and forgoing the opportunity to adhere to the strategy.[ cite]
