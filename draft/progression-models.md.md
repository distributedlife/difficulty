Sine - a cyclical model that floats between -1.0 and 1.0 in the shape of a wave
Cosine - a cyclical model that is the inverse of the sine wave
Arctangent - 
Asymptotic - The progression tapers off towards the asymptote but never reaches it.
Linear - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Percentage - Each progression is based on a percentage of the prior progression: 100, 110, 121, 133.1, 146.41 (a 10% increase); This is also used in games like Left 4 Dead where health is restore at 80% of the deficit. 40/100 Health is restored to 88/100. If a second pack was applied the health would restore to: 97/100.
Fibonacci - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
Exponential - 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
Geometric - 1, 3, 6, 18, 54
Logarithmic - 1, 10, 100, 1000
