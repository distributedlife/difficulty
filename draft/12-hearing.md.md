## Hearing
Hearing is the ability to interpret and respond to game events by listening to sounds. Many games have an audio aspect to them but do not many games require the players to be good at hearing to participate. **Real Sound: Kaze No Regrets** is a game designed for the vision impaired people. No visual aspect of the game exists and the players have to listen and at appropriate times make decisions using the controller. **Papa Sangre** is another game that requires the players to hear although it does has a small visual aspect.

> **Hearing**: gaining a competitive advantage having better hearing than another player.

## Difficulty Vectors
- Sound
- Noise
- Fidelity
- Direction
- Volume

**Noise** - By placing distracting sounds it becomes harder for the player to identify the objective (the signal) the rest (the noise). The signal-to-noise ratio can be shifted to make it easier or harder for the player.

**Fidelity** - By reducing fidelity we reduce similarity between competing sounds. Fidelity differs from noise because, with fidelity, all the competing sounds are important. Noise is closer to a binary partition where there are *correct* and *incorrect* sounds.

**Direction** - The player has to identify direction as well as the sound. The closer the sound is to the centre the harder it will be for the player to determine which direction the sound is coming from. 

**Volume** - By reducing the volume down it becomes harder to clearly identify the sounds. Players will impaired hearing will find these games more difficult.

## Example Games
The Challenge-Response game I devised for this book shows of each of the hearing trait vectors. The game is played like a reaction test. A key difference is there is no time aspect. The player does not have to respond within a given time period. The player has to response when they hear the cue.

1. [Noise](/challenge-response/hearing/noise) - As each level progress the noise in the channel is increased.
2. [Fidelity](/challenge-response/hearing/fidelity) - This version has two buttons; the player must click the correct button corresponding to the sound. As the game progresses the sounds become more similar.
3. [Direction](/challenge-response/hearing/direction) - This version has two buttons and requires stereo speakers. The player must click the correct button corresponding to which side the sound was played from. As the game progresses the sounds move towards the centre.
4. [Volume](/challenge-response/hearing/volume) - As each level progress the volume becomes quieter.

### Irrelevant
*Chess* - No special hearing skills are required.

### Relevant
*Real Sound: Kaze no Regrets* - The game is entirely audio based although having better hearing won’t make you a better player.

*Papa Sangre* - The game requires the player to hear in order to navigate the game world.

### Vital
*Hearing Test* - The supplied hearing test game is designed to ensure that players with the best hearing can win the game.
