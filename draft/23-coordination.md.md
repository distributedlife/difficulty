Jungle Speed is a game where each player has a stack of cards in their hands. These are placed face up on the table on at a time. If the pattern on your card matches another face up card on the table then you must try and grab the token from the middle of the table. 

Normally the player with the fastest grab (speed) or quickest reaction (reflexes) will win. However when you grab it you must not knock it over. It must be a clean take. Only players with sufficient coordination can win.

> **Coordination**: gaining a competitive advantage by moving your body, implement, avatar or cursor around the playing arena with more accuracy and precision than your opponent.

Fighting games like boxing or martial arts required high degrees of accuracy to land strikes. Computer games often increase coordination skills as means of increasing difficulty; smaller targets, faster moving targets, less predictable targets, etc.

## Difficulty Vectors
**Target Size** - By reducing the size of the target the players have to be both more accurate and more precise. It is important to note that When the target is placed at the edge of the player arena, e.g. the screen, then the size of the target stretches to infinity.

Consider the two illustrations below. The X marks the spot where the player must click. In the first example the target runs along the edge of the screen. The player just needs to move the mouse as fast as they can against the edge knowing that the boundary of the screen will stop the cursor at the correct position. In the second illustration the player has to be more precise as the edge of the screen is not considered part of the target.

TODO: add the illustrations in here.

## Example Games
The Box Clicker game has been created to show the impact of coordination. As the levels progress coordination becomes more pronounced.

1. [Coordination](/box-clicker/coordination)

### Irrelevant
*Chess* - Being coordinated has no impact over the outcome of the game.

### Relevant
*Cricket* - Cricket is a team game where coordination is required for batting, bowling and fielding. Being coordinated can have an impact on the outcome of the game but being the most coordinated will not dictate you are the winner as there are other traits at play.

### Vital
*QWOP* - This game requires a high degree of coordination in order to move the actor.

*Jungle Speed* - The player is required to have precision at high speed in order to successfully grab the token without knocking it over.

*Boxing* - Being able to strike quickly, accurately and with precision will determine the difference between a hit or a blocked.
