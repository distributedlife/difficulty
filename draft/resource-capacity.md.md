The capacity of the resource is how much of it you can have. Constraints force the player to use the excess or suffer wastage.

There are number of different resource capacity models.

Fixed Capacity - You can have between 0 and 100 health. 0 equates to death.  Any more than 0 is a degree of healthiness. When the player is near 100 health picking up health packs is an easy decision.

Contracts - The resource capacity can only shrink. This is the damage to your car when you can’t repair it. It could also been the fuel in your car if your can refuel. The damage example puts pressure on the player not to damage their car. The fuel example might allow the player to use more to go faster and less to go slower. The challenge is managing the resource knowing that you can’t get any more. 

If you can’t refuel or repair than the model is fixed.

Expands - Your capacity can increase over the course of the game. A young mage might only be able to remember two spells. As the game progress then their capacity to remember more spells is increased.

Fluid - Your capacity expands and decreases over the course of the game. In the game Don’t Starve, finding some possessions allow you to carry more items. Like a rucksack. If you drop the rucksack then your capacity is reduced again.
