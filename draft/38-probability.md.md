Consistent (Poker) - If we reshuffled the deck after every hand then we know that the chance of any card coming out is the same.
Consistent Weighted (Yahtzee) - A variation on consistent is when we have two dice and we roll then. The chance of rolling a 7 is much greater than rolling a 2 or a 12.
Eventual (Pandemic) - We know that there are epidemics in the deck. They will be revealed sooner or later. The challenge is knowing when it is coming and not if.
