Change, Fortune, entropy, randomness, lord and lady luck. Luck is randomness when it ends up in your favour. Games introduce randomness to move a game away from a pure decision tree. Tic-Tac-Toe and Checkers are both pure decision trees. From any starting move every counter can be calculated to win. Because of this they are now broken games. It is possible to always win.

Luck: to gain a competitive advantage through randomness inherit in the game.

Difficulty Vectors
Randomness - The more you introduce randomness into the game the harder it is for players to be certain of the outcome.

Example Games
Irrelevant
Tic-Tac-Toe - This game does not involve luck of any kind.

Up and Down the River - Up and Down the River is a game that illustrates the influence of luck on the game. The game involves 20 rounds, the first and last round involve hands of 10 cards per player. The number of cards per hand is reduced for each successive round until there are two rounds of 1 card hands and then then hand size starts increasing again.

On each round, each player must nominate the number of tricks they intend to win. The last player in the round, when it is there time to nominate their tricks can say a number that will result in the total number of tricks nominated to equal the number of cards in the hand. So for a round of 10 cards and 3 players. The first person nominates 5, the second 3. This means the last person can’t nominate 2. This is important.

When it comes to a 1 card hand. The first person might nominate 0 tricks won. If the second person nominates 0 then third must also nominate 0 (0+0+0 < 1). If the second person nominated 1 then the third person has to nominate 1 too (0+1+1 > 1).

Then the players reveal their cards and score the round. The third player has no say in their nomination for the round. If they win they were lucky. If they lose then they were unlucky. But when the number of cards is 10 per hand, the third player can nominate a range of numbers and luck has less influence.

 

Vital
Coin Flip - You have a 50% chance of getting the correct answer. It’s common for sports games to start with a coin toss to determine which direction a team will start from.

Two Up - Two pennies are tossed and people bet on whether it will land as two heads, two tails or one of each (odds). It’s a gambling game and therefore randomness plays a big part in it.
