The classic prediction game is rock-paper-scissors. If you can predict the other player’s actions then you will win. Prediction is knowing what another player will do next – good ol’ rock, nothin’ beats that. Prediction doesn’t cover how you arrive at the conclusion, just that you have. 

Prediction: gaining a competitive advantage from being able to predict another player’s action.

Difficulty Vectors
Layering - In Rock-Paper-Scissors there are dead moves Rock-Rock, Paper-Paper, Scissors-Scissors. For the other combinations a winner can be determined. The standard sequence is: Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock.

If we consider two moves that player A can make. M and C2. Player B can make two different moves C1 and C3. 

The loop is as follows:
C3 > C2 > C1 > M > C3…

Now for any combination thrown either Player A or Player B will win. Each player has two moves and it’s now a matter for each player to decide which move is the correct one.

This example if from David Sirlin.
