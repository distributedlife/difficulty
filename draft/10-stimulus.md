# Stimuli
The first skills that we are going to look at all related to how, in games, we receive stimuli and respond. I will talk about three in this book: vision, hearing and tactile. There are other ways to receive stimuli but this are less often used in games. 

- **Vision** (*Where’s Wally/Where's Waldo*)
- **Hearing** (*Papa Sangre*)
- **Tactile** (*Duck Duck Goose*)

These skills will form the basis of all the other skills listed in this book. While stimuli are important their significance can be increased or reduced by different vectors and we'll discuss those for each stimuli although there will similarities across all three.
