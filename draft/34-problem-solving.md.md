TODO: rename this to problem solving. Logic is a problem to solve, as is arithmetic.

Logic
In the game of sudoku you have to ensure that each row and column has a 1 through to 9 and that each smaller square as 1 through to 9. From looking at what numbers are already placed you can deduce what some squares must contain. This deduction is logic.

Logic: gaining a competitive advantage by being able to apply logic better than your opponent

Difficulty Vectors
Hops - If I give you the statement that ‘All men are mortal’ and that ‘I am a man’ then you can deduce that ‘I am mortal’. This is a single jump. If I were to change the puzzle so that INSERT PUZZLE HERE. You would have to hold more information in your head in order to resolve the puzzle.

Data (is this just Stamina?) - A 3x3 logic puzzle is more simple than a 5x5 puzzle as there is more things to work out and more relationships between the data.

Example Games
Irrelevant
Two-Up - The gambling game where two pennies are tossed and people bet on what the result will be. As the outcome is random it’s not possible to deduce what the outcome will be.

Relevant
Knights of the Old Republic - The player has to complete the Tower of Hanoi as a side quest.

Vital
Mastermind - The codebreaker has to use deduction to determine what the four colour code is.

Raven’s Progressive Matrices - The subject has to respond with what is the next in the sequence. This involves both pattern matching and logic to determine the next item in the sequence.

Sudoku - The determination of what number goes in which box can always be worked out with logic.
