Risk management is our ability to weigh up the likelihood of a reward versus an initial or ongoing stake.

Dealing with probability / uncertainty
Making the best choice with limited information
Will x occur? Or how long can I leave x?

Risk Management: gaining a competitive advantage by being better able to weigh up the  the likelihood of events occurring.

Difficulty Vectors
Randomness - Each card in a deck of playing cards has 1 in 52 of being drawn. If we reshuffle the deck after each draw then the probability remains the same but the change of it ever coming out is now a factor.

Incomplete Data - One variant of Mahjong is to use a dead wall. These tiles are separated at the start of the game and are never used. No one knows which tiles are in the dead wall and this makes it more difficult to determine the likelihood of a particular tile being drawn.

Example Games
Irrelevant
Sudoku - As the game is entirely logic based there is no risk of one move over another.

Relevant
Carcassonne - The tile placement aspect of the game can result in a situation where you are unsure if you can finish a particular road or city.

Ninjato - Yelling Banzai allows you to keep stealing things. This increases the risk as more guards come but also increases the chance of reward.

Vital
Poker - All forms of poker require you to weigh up likelihood that your hand is good verses other player’s hands.

Jenga - Different blocks to pull out are inherently more risky than others. The player has to weigh up if they should or can remove a block.

Geometry Wars - How long you can leave a black hole for before you have to deal with it.
