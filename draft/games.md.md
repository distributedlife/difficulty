Throughout this book I will be using several simple computer games to illustrate my examples. These games are all free, they are available online and should work on most phone browsers.

Each game has been reworked to show off, where possible, each trait individually and to show how that trait can be made easier and harder. Where possible, games have been made to demonstrate the difference between the *hearing* and *vision* traits. Additionally multiplayer versions of the games have been made because competition is fun!

All the games and their variations are listed here. Some of the variations might not be clear until the chapter that introduces that trait or difficulty vector has been read. The section is as much a reference as it is an overview.

Start it up and play through each of the levels. Don’t worry there is no progression limiters in the games so each level is played once, -you can’t die- and you can see your score for each level at the end.

# Box Clicker
The Box Clicker game is one that shows off *coordination*, *reflexes* and *prediction*. The basic premise is that there is a box on the screen. The player has to click to the box.

- [coordination (size)](/box-clicker/coordination)

1.1. The targets only appear around the edges, this means each target’s size is infinity. There is no time constraint.
1.2. Have been moved in from the edges. This gives each target a real size. There is no time constraint.
1.3. The size of the targets has been reduced to make them harder to hit. There is no time constraint.
1.4. The size of the targets shrink to zero over the course of it’s life. There is a time constraint but it’s not a challenging one.

# Challenge-Response
The Challenge-Response game is designed to show off *reflexes*, *hearing*, *vision* and *tone recognition*. Depending on the trait being tested, the game will with require a button to be pressed with the challenge is presented or one of two buttons. 

All the games in this suite are designed to reduce the influence of coordination in the game although this is always a challenge.

- [vision, reflexes](/challenge-response/vision-reflexes/no-limit)
- [vision, reflexes (maximum)](/challenge-response/vision-reflexes/maximum)
- [vision (noise), reflexes](/challenge-response/vision-noise)
- [vision (fidelity), reflexes](/challenge-response/vision-fidelity)
- [hearing, reflexes](/challenge-response/hearing-reflexes/no-limit)
- [hearing, reflexes (maximum)](/challenge-response/hearing-reflexes/maximum)
- [hearing, reflexes (noise)](/challenge-response/hearing-reflexes/noise)
- [hearing, reflexes (fidelity)](/challenge-response/hearing-reflexes/fidelity)
- [hearing, reflexes (direction)](/challenge-response/hearing-reflexes/direction)
- [hearing, reflexes (volume)](/challenge-response/hearing-reflexes/volume)
- [hearing, tone recognition](/challenge-response/tone-recognition)

The next variations on the game are design to reduce the influence of reflexes on the game. Any key can be pressed and you’ve got all the time in the world to press it. The question is whether or not you hear the cue.

- [hearing (noise)](/challenge-response/hearing/noise)
- [hearing (fidelity)](/challenge-response/hearing/fidelity)
- [hearing (direction)](/challenge-response/hearing/direction)
- [hearing (volume)](/challenge-response/hearing/volume)

# Touch Typing Sprint
This game is a speed game. Words will come up onto the screen and the faster you can correctly type the words the faster you’re avatar will move. If you can get over the finish line first, you win.

- [speed](/touch-typing-sprint)

# Deck Sorter
This game requires the player to *sort a deck of cards*. The suit is displayed in the middle of the screen. Around the edges of the screen are a number of cards. These are placed along the edge to reduce the impact of coordination. The player has to select the Ace followed by the 2 and so on through each of the four suits.

- [speed](/deck-sorter)

# Pairs
This game is one that has existed for hundreds of years across multiple cultures. The basic version of the game requires the player to overturn cards looking for matching pairs. This game will be used to demonstrate the *memory*, *hearing* and *vision* traits.

- [vision, memory, ? vector](/pairs/vision-memory/?)
- [hearing, memory, ? vector](/pairs/hearing-memory/?)
