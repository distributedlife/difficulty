If you’ve played Pairs then you’ve played a pattern matching game. You have to find the exact match to win. Pattern matching is not always about finding exact matches as games such as Tetris and jigsaw puzzle are both pattern matching games. The former is about comparing objects. The latter two are about fitting new pieces into an larger pattern.

Pattern Matching: gaining a competitive advantage by being able to identify patterns better than your opponent.

Difficulty Vectors
To make pattern matching more difficult you can explore the following spectrums: precision and sequence

Fidelity: The difference between the correct pattern and incorrect pattern is subtle. If we take the pairs game and we start off with dog, giraffe and elephant you can easily compare the patterns. If we move to a second round where the eight subspecies of giraffe are compared with each other then it becomes hard to pick out the correct matches. Or for a Jigsaw puzzle if we are trying to assemble a picture of a bowl of smarties then every piece is going to be similar.

Sequence: The player isn’t looking for an exact match but what the next tile in the sequence will be. If I give you the sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8 and the following potential answers 10, -1, Infinity. Then you can use your pattern matching trait to pick the correct answer.

Example Games
Irrelevant
Cross-Country Skiing - Being able to detect patterns is not a required trait of of cross-country skiing players.

Relevant
International Chess -  Being able to identify whether your opponent is apply a previously known move will help you apply the counter-strategy.

Vital
Tetris - Being able to identify patterns will allow you to best place tiles and complete lines.

Bejewelled - A player better able to detect patterns will be able to match 4, 5 and L-shape combinations.

Snap - A player is required to compare two cards to see if they are the same.

Jungle Speed - A player is required to compare two card to see if they have the same pattern but not the same colour.Strategy is our longer term plan. Tactics are opportunistic short term decisions that can go directly against our strategy. A tactical bombing is one that achieves an immediate value in the war. A strategic bombing is one that tries to debilitate the enemies ability to wage war[ cite this].

In a game that allows multiple victory conditions, then choosing one of these is a strategy. In games with only one victory condition coming up with how you achieve victory is your strategy. It might be “buy every house you land on” in Monopoly.

Strategy: gaining a competitive advantage by making better strategic decisions than your opponents.

Pure abstract strategy is a decision tree. There is no chance and no hidden element. This is chess. When you add chance you get Backgammon, when you add the hidden element then you get Stratego.


Difficulty Vectors
Paths - Having more paths to victory makes it harder to pick the one that will get you there before any other players.

Complexity - Pure abstract strategy is a decision tree. You can work out all the moves in advance if you have the computing power. You can make this harder to do by making the number of potential moves very large. Checkers used to have this but it’s possible for a computer to work it all out. Chess and Go still have this.

Hidden Element - If you make some information in the game invisible then it becomes harder to compute the best move.

Chance - If you make some elements of the game random then it becomes impossible to permute the perfect course.

Example Games
Irrelevant
Sprinting - There is no strategy required in this game.

Relevant
Poker - Putting someone ‘on-tilt’ in order to upset their strategy.

Vital
Civilisation - There are multiple ways for a player to win the game. Each of these different ways is a strategy.

Chess - Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play[ cite]. A tactical decision in chess is one where you have the choice between: making a gain at the cost of your existing strategy and forgoing the opportunity to adhere to the strategy.[ cite]
