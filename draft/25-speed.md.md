If I can run 100 metres faster than you, I win. If I can answer add up all the number from 1 to 100 faster than you, I win. 

The answer is 5,050. I win.

Speed differs from reactions by being able to do something more quickly instead of being the fasteirst to respond to some stimulistart. The longer the game the less influence your reaction has in the game.

> **Speed**: gaining a competitive advantage by doing something more quickly than your opponent.

## Difficulty Vectors
There are two ways that we can make speed games harder. We can set a minimum speed and we can set a maximum speed.

### Minimum Speed
In the game *Papers Please* the player is paid for each applicant correctly processesd. This money is used to pay for rent, food, heating and medicine that your sick, cold and starving family requires. To pay for **all** of these things the player must process a minimum number of applicants per day. Each day is a timed period. Theseis combines to set a minimum speed for the player. As the game progresses the costs go up, increasing the minimum speed.

Minimum speed is about punishing the player for not completing tasks quick enough. The player who is the fastest should be at an advantage.

Endless Runner games appear to have a minimum speed because the game doesn't let the player slow down. These games are about reactions rather than about being the fastest to complete a task. Furthermore, these games don't allow the player to speed up or slow down as the player wishes.

### Maximum Speed
Just as setting a minimum speed can make a game harder, setting a maximum speed within the right context will also make a game harder. Racing games frequently apply maximum speeds. One type of car might have a lower maximum speed than another, a tighter corner requires a lower entrance speed than a more relaxed turn. 

The first type of maximum speed is a handicap; this car is slower. You can't go faster than the maximum. The second type is a punishment model; everyone must go slower here. You *can* go faster but the consequences are usually not worth the effort. Coming off the track or crashing into a barrier are common problems.

These games still require the fastest player to win. The game is played within the context of an absolute maximum speed. Within the physics of the game world, no driver can go faster than a certain time; a perfect drive. The game is about who can get closest to the absolute maximum.

## Example Games
The *Touch Typing Sprint* game has been devised to show off speed. Naturally, as it requires touch typing it involves coordination. A second game, *Deck Sorter*, is a speed game that tries to reduce the influence of coordination.

### Touch Typing Sprint
In this game the players have to type out words as they appear. Each letter pressed gives their avatar a speed boost. The fastest typer of correct words will get their avatar to the finish line first.

There are three versions of each game. A version with no limits, one where the player has to deal with a minimum speed and one where a maximum speed is in place.

- Touch Typing Sprint: No Limits - This version lets the player take as long as they want to type each word. The fastest player wins.
- Touch Typing Spring: Minimum Speed - In this version failing to type the word before the timer runs out costs a penalty of the runner tripping on a hurdle. Hurdles cost the sprinter speed and time.
- Touch Typing Spring: Maximum Speed - In this version the player has to ensure that they do not type the words too quickly. A completed word has the runner jumping hurdles. Jumping too early will result in the runner tripping over.

### Deck Sorter
This game has the players sorting a deck of cards by clicking on the next card. All players are trying to click on the next card in the deck. The first to click scores the card. The player with the most cards at the end wins.

- Deck Sorter: No Limits - This version lets the player take as long as they want to select the next card. The player with the highest score (fastest) wins.
- Deck Sorter: Minimum Speed - This version fails all players if the card is not selected before a timer runs out.
- Deck Sorter: Maximum Speed - This version limits the player to one mouse click per second interval. The players have to race within the constraints. The same interval is used for all players (rather than each player having their own timer).

### Irrelevant
*Chess* - Thinking fast doesn’t matter as the player can take as long as they want to make a move.
*Javalin* - Being faster at through a javalin won't help you win
*Gone Home* - As this game eschews competitive objectives being the fastest won't help you.

### Relevant
*Fast Chess* - These variants on chess range from 1 minute games, 10 seconds per move and up to an hour per game. All of these push the ability to think fast up to relevant status. I don't consider Fast Chess a game where *speed* is **vital** because the game is still turn based.

*Biathlon* - Shooting and either running or skiing long distances. Each missed target results in extra distance or time added to the player's score. A slower, accurate player can beat a faster, less accurate opponent.

*Super Mario Kart* - Being the fastest is important, as with all racing games, however through the use of power-ups and rubber-banding there is an additional strategy as well. The fastest racer is often the target of aggression from other racers and is less likely to win.

### Vital
*Sprinting* - Running the fastest over 100 metres will make you the winner.

*Motorsports* - Being able to drive your car around the track faster than other players will make you the winner. The sport of Formula 1 applies *minimum speed* by knocking out drivers from qualifying that do not set a fast enough time.

*Jungle Speed* - Being the fastest at *pattern matching* is essential for winning.

*Gran Turismo* - Being the fastest to drive around the track makes you the winner.


# TODO
The player had an hour to achieve some task. Then for some arbitrary reason that we all hope is internally consistent with the narrative they player now only has five minutes to defuse the bomb or whatever. 

This is a play to increase the pressure on the player while keeping the other traits at the same difficulty.
