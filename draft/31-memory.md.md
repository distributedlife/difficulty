Memory is the ability to recall information when required. Memory doesn’t factor much into physical games but is required more in table-top gaming.

The memory trait is one where you gain a competitive advantage from having a better memory than another player.

Difficulty Vectors
The memory trait has three vectors that can be used to make the trait more difficult: age, size and noise.

Age: how long ago was the information provided to the the player. If I told you the four numbers as you typed them in, then no memory is required. If I told you them yesterday and you didn’t write them down, then I hope you’ve got a good memory. The longer ago I tell you the numbers the more your memory is tested.

Size: how much information you are required to remember. A single digit number is easy, a four digit number hard, a 20 digit number might be too much for you. The more information the harder your memory is tested..

Noise: the inclusion of information that you are not required or are not sure you needto remember but can’t tell the difference. If I tell you two four digit numbers but only one of them unlocks the door then the other is noise. The more noise I give you the harder it is for you to remember. I doesn’t have to be the same information either, I could also tell you to remember the names of fifteen rabbits and the four digit code. 

Include the fish tank game.not knowing what to remember makes it harder.

Order: remembering the things is no not enough, you now have to remember the order as well. This is variation on size and illustrates that *more* doesn't just mean more of that type of data but other aspects of the data can be included as well.

How long we have to remember it: an instant, 10 minutes 


Example Games
Irrelevant
Weightlifting - The player is not required to remember anything about the game in order to compete.

Suduko - All information is available at the time of puzzle.

Relevant
Gone Home - There are a couple of trivial puzzles that involve remembering a four digit code from another room. It doesn’t make the game any harder but merely gives the player a small task.

International Chess - Chess players are required to remember a collection of openings, endings and play arrangements. While it is still possible purely based on the state of the board it’s become a de facto requirement.

Vital
Pairs - This game involves a set of cards that are turned faced down. The players take turns revealing two cards in the hope that they match. If they don’t match the cards are turned face down again. Players have to remember where the cards are and are not allowed to write down positions.
