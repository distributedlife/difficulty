Two people start running at the same speed, the one who stops running first loses. This is stamina. A marathon is a running event that lasts for at least 2 hours. The Tour de France is a three week bike ride. Games that require stamina often require an extended playing period. This is not always the case. I consider stamina as any time period in which the ability to endure without giving up is the defining characteristic.

> **Stamina**: gaining a competitive advantage by being able to endure longer than your opponent.

## Difficulty Vectors
*Duration* - If you want to make something more difficult; make it take longer and the traits required to win will have to be applied over the entire game duration.

## Example Games
I didn’t make any special games for this trait. I recommend you fire up minesweeper or head out for a quick triathlon.

### Irrelevant
*Chess* - While it is common for games to last a long time, being able to play for longer won’t change the outcome.

### Relevant
*Tour Cycling* - The three week cycling events require stamina to complete. Without the stamina you cannot win and many riders fail to finish the race. But being able to outlast other riders is insufficient.

*Minesweeper* - Going to a higher skill level in minesweeper changes nothing in the game yet it makes the game harder. You have to play at your best for much longer. This is bringing stamina into play.

### Vital
*Ironman Triathlon* - Swim 3.8 km, bike 180.25 km and then run 42.2 km. Being able to finish is the deciding factor. Do it within 17 hours and *speed* becomes a secondary trait
