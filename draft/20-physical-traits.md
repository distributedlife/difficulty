# Physical SkillTraits
To see what makes one person better at a game than another person we need to compare them. One way to do that is by comparing physical skilltraits. The Olympic Games has been doing this for over a hundred years.

Physical skills are, to an extent, governed by our genetics and the environment that we grew up in. Both your nutrition and the genetics of your parents will influence how tall you will be. Once you've grown to a certain height you can't grow any more. This doesn’t mean that physical skills cannot be improved. All athletes work very hard to become as good as they are.  All this means that when you’re designing a game that relies on these skills you need to consider how this influences which players are going to win will be better. 

Below is the list of skilltraits that I classify as physical and some example games. I’ve tried to put in a good mix of computer, physical and table top games where possible to show how the same skillstrait manifests in different games.

- **Reactions** (*Fencing*, *Temple Run*, *Lighting Reaction*)
- **Coordination** (*QWOP*, *Tennis*, *Box Clicker*)
- **Speed** (*Sprinting*, *Jungle Speed*, *Speed Chess*)
- **Rhythm** (*Dance Dance Revolution*, *Figure Skating*)
- **Stamina** (*Marathon*, *Minesweeper*)

The following three physical skilltraits relate to how we interact with games. These traits also interplay well with the skilltraits listed above.

- **Vision** (*Where’s Wally*)
- **Hearing** (*Papa Sangre*)
- **Tactile** (*Duck Duck Goose*)

### Other Physical SkillTraits
There are a few other skilltraits that are physical in nature that I won’t go into. These skilltraits tend to only manifest in a small subset, usually outdoor sporting physical games and lack the complexity that other skilltraits have.

- **Strength** (*Weightlifting*, *Shot Put*)
- **Height** (*Basketball*, *Volleyball*)
- **Singing** (*Sing Star*)
