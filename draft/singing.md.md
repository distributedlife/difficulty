Singing as a trait is the ability to emit sound at a certain pitch and tone. Games like Sing Star using pitch detection to determine how accurate the player is.

> **Singing**: gaining a competitive advantage by being able to emit sound of a certain pitch and tone more accurately and with more precision than your opponent.

## Difficulty Vectors
**Precision** - On early levels we could allow the player to get near enough to the note to pass. But as we progress we could require them to become ever more precise.

## Example Games
I have not made any games that illustrate singing as a trait.

### Irrelevant
*International Chess* - Being able to sing better than the other player won’t help you win.

### Relevant
There are no games where this is a relevant requirement.

### Vital
*Sing Star* - Being able to hit the correct notes directly influences your score.
