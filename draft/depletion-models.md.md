## Depletion Models
- **Inexhaustible** (*Victory Points in Settlers of Catan*)
- **Depletes** (*Sanity in Don't Starve*)

#### Inexhaustible
Inexhaustible - You can never use up the resource. A simple example is Victory Points in games that use them; or weapons in first person shooters. The weapons themselves rarely wear out and break although ammunition depletes

#### Depletes
 - You can use up the resource. Ammunition is an example.


## Depletion Agents
- **Nothing** (**)
- **Time (decay)** (*Sanity in Don't Starve*)
- **Place** (*Health when on lava in Quake*)
- **Exchange** (**)
- **Use** (**)
- **Action** (**)
- **Proxy Metrix** (*Fatigue in Fallout 4*)

#### Nothing
 - Used for inexhaustible resources

#### Time (decay)
 - The resource decays over time. This could be a hunger metric in games. 

#### Place
 - The resource decays while in a specific area. This could be sanity whenever you’re near Cthulhu. Health goes down when the floor is lava and you’re standing on it.

#### Exchange
 - If you have 5 wood you can trade it for 1 health kit. Your wood resource quantity has gone down.

#### Use
Use - You can use a health kit (potential health) and apply it to your wounds. This increases your (actual health). This depletes your health kit resource.

#### Action
 - The action of an actor decays the resource. This could be fuel in a car. By driving the car you use petrol.

#### Proxy Metric
The resource in question depletes because of some other metric is increasing or decreasing. As fatigue increase in Fallout 4 the more likely the player will become suscepitble to weakness which impacts endurance and then health.
