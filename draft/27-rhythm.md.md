Rhythm and Coordination are closely linked. Rhythm is knowing when to act while coordination is your ability to perform the act. In skipping ropes the player must be able to jump (coordination) and the player must jump at the correct time (rhythm). Because of this almost any time rhythm is required by a game, coordination is required as well. But coordination itself doesn’t require rhythm.

A simple game that would require rhythm and no coordination is one where you are asked to repeat a rhythm after hearing it once. All you need to do is say the word "now" at the appropriate time. “Now…now…now…now”. This wouldn't require any special level of coordination and would require rhythm. I call this game Metronome.

> **Rhythm**: gaining a competitive advantage by being able to identify and then act upon the rhythm better than your opponent.

## Difficulty Vectors
*Unusual* - By making the rhythms less rhythmic, i.e. by introducing notes on off-beats, we can the game more difficult. Here is a 4x4 beat and a 4x4 with an off beat. Each x is a drum beat and the c is a clap.

x...x...x...x...|x...x...x...x...|
x...x...x...x..c|x...x...x...x..c|

The last clap will throw some people out of rhythm.

*Precision* - On early levels we could allow the player to get near enough to the rhythm to pass. But as we progress we could require them to become ever more precise.

## Example Games
The Metronome game has been created to show the impact of rhythm. The player is given a rhythm and after the game has commenced the player has to maintain the rhythm.

- [rhythm (precision)](/challenge-response/rhythm-precision) - This version forces the player to be more precise at each successive level
- [rhythm (unusual)](/challenge-response/rhythm-unusual) - This version has increasingly less rhythmic rhythms in order to throw the player off.

### Irrelevant
*Chess* - Having a better rhythm than the other player will not help you win.

*Darts* - Darts requires coordination but no rhythm.

### Relevant
*Rock Band* - Both the guitars and the drummer require rhythm to compete. As the game is really about memory and coordination, rhythm only helps to a degree.

### Vital
*MaiMai* - The player has to press buttons or swipe the screen in time with the music. Coordination and Speed are also required for this game.

*Rope Skipping* -  This game requires coordination to be able to jump while rhythm is used to know when to jump.

*Figure Skating* - This sport requires a high degree of co-ordination and rhythm.
