## Vision
Vision is the ability to identify stimuli using our eyes. Vision is a core requirement in many games in that you need your eyes just to participate, let alone be a defining factor. I don’t consider this a game design choice. A more interesting choice is when you specifically don’t need eyes to play or when the game is designed to favour those who distrust their eyes over other senses. Games where vision is considered vital are hidden object games like *Where’s Wally*.

> **Vision**: gaining a competitive advantage having better eyesight than another player.

### Difficulty Vectors
- Cue Prominence (Size, colour, silhouette, contrast, duration of indication, etc) 
- Noise
- Fidelity
- Position
- Prior Knowledge

#### Cue Prominence
Cue prominence is an umbrella term for how easy it is for the player to identify the cue. This encompasses the size of the cue, what colour it is, it's shape or identifiable silhouette or whether it can be seen against it's background.

##### Size
When considering the size of the cue, consider not just how big it is but whether or not the size changes. At the start of each F1 race there is a set of lights that go red before going out. These are same size at every track.

	Easier | Larger <--> Smaller | Harder
	Easier | Consistent <--> Varied | Harder

##### Colour
	Easier | Consistant <--> Varied | Harder

##### Silhouette
	Easier | Distinct <--> Similar | Harder

##### Contrast
	Easier | Stronger <--> Weaker | Harder




But it also includes whether the player knows what the cue is going to be.

This is about the size of the visual cue. (also about the contrast) or how easy it is to identify the cue.

I guess knowing what the cue is. How will you know it's me? You'll know.

Only some visual elements are important


#### Noise
**Distracting Noise** - Distracting noise tries to overwhelm the player with noise. By putting lots of additional information in the field of view it becomes harder for the player to identify the objective (the signal) from all the noise.

**Subtle Noise** - Subtle noise tries to trick the player by being as close to the cue as possible. Lot’s of subtle noise makes it harder for the player to see the correct one. Subtle noise is similar to fidelity.

All visual elements are important

**Fidelity** - By reducing fidelity we reduce similarity between competing visual cues. Fidelity differs from noise because all the competing visual cues are important. Noise is closer to a binary partition where there are *correct* and *incorrect* sounds.

TODO: this is choice
**Discrimination** - Like fidelity, in discrimination all visual cues are important. The difference is that a vector is chosen (length, height, brightness, etc) and the player has to make a decision based on

### Example Games
There are two versions of the Challenge-Response game that have been created for the vision trait. One to show the impact of noise and one to show the impact of fidelity.

- Noise - This game tries to distract the player with similar coloured shapes. As the game progress the noise becomes more distracting.
- Fidelity - This game requires the player to response A or B depending on what colour they see. A and B become more similar as the levels progress.


#### Irrelevant
*Blind Cricket* - Blind cricket is played with a noisy ball. This allows blind players to hear where the ball is.

#### Relevant
*Skeet Shooting* - Vision can play a large part in seeing and identifying the target. Player’s also use *prediction* to guess where the skeet will be.

*Cross Country Skiing* - Being able to look ahead and identify a path can give the player a competitive advantage but not enough to consistently win.

#### Vital
*Where’s Wally* - The player has to identify wally in the midst of many other similarly coloured environments. The player’s ability to pick wally out is key here. *Where's Wally* makes use of a lot of *noise* to distract the player.
