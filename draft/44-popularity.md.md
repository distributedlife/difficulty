Every election is a popularity contest. The most popular candidate gets elected. Popularity is different to politics in that you’re not trying to persuade people to do something on your behalf, you want them to vote for you.

Popularity: gaining a competitive advantage by being preferred over other candidates.

- Manifests as metagames where unpopular players are teamed up against.
- Might seem unfair as the train comes from ‘outside the game’ but this is like all the physical attributes, you’ve got it or you don’t and if you don’t then you need to work on it. Luck is like this.
- Anonymity is a play to counter this (or play with only people you like)
