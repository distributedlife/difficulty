Some resources are locked. An example of this is a weapon that can only be used by a player of Level 32 and above. This is often used as a progression limiter in the game. You don’t want less experienced players from acquiring the good gear and overcoming the game without spending a minimum amount of time playing.

If you give a player a locked resources they have to trade of the value of carrying the weapon and using up a storage spot (consumes the space resource) or leaving it. This is both risk management (will I get another good weapon later) and resource management (can I afford to take this).

When I played Borderlands 2 my playing technique resulted in me being in most areas 3-5 levels below that of what I should have been. This meant that every weapon dropped was locked and designed for a player that was more experienced. I had two options: grind away on some side quests or heavily manage my resources. I had limited space so I had to carry the weapons I could use now, some weapons for a 1-2 levels from now a weapons for 4-5 levels from now. If I didn’t take the gear I would end up with the experience and no suitable gear and if I always took the latest gear I would never get the experience to use them.

It proved to be a real challenge but I managed the defeat Handsome Jack in the end.
