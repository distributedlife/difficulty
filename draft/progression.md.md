Progression is how the game is unlocked as you play it. By unlocking I mean the giving of abilities, equipment, narrative, etc to the player.


Examples:

Money
The amount of money in the real world influences how far the player can progress. A game where it costs money to play or payments unlock abilities

People
The more people you invite to the game then the more progress you can make (Viral).

In Built Progression
The player has to work through the game to progress and unlock abilities. This is most games (Quake, Batman Arkham Asylum, etc)

Time
The more time the player can put into the game then the more things are unlocked. MMOs are like this and any game where grinding is necessary.

No Progression
Street Fighter is a game where there is no progression. Each player starts with everything that can be done by a fighter. To be a better play then you need the right traits.
