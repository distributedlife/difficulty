NOTE: I think the vector below is just the combination of coordination and speed. Being coordinated isn’t enough, you now have to be fast.
**Target Speed** - By moving the target the player has to track where the target is going in order to hit it. The faster the target moves the harder it is to hit.

NOTE: The vector below is just the combination of coordination and prediction.
**Target Behaviour** - If the target is moving it is harder to hit. If it moves in a predictable fashion e.g. in skeet shooting, it brings prediction into play. If the target moves in an irregular fashion e.g. appearing randomly on the screen, then it removes the influence of prediction and replaces it with reflexes.

2. Coordination and Speed
2.1. Each target now moves across the screen at a consistent pace. *The targets are along the edge to give them infinity size*.
2.2. The targets move faster.
3. Coordination & Prediction
3.1. The targets change speed either slowing down, or speeding up. *The targets are along the edge to give them infinity size*.
3.2. The targets fade out after 1 second.
3.3. The targets are on screen for only one second before the randomly move to a new position. The targets don’t move.
4. Combined
4.1. The targets randomly appear, track in a random direction for 0.5 second; at the 0.5 second mark they change direction again and shrink to zero and fade out over the next 0.5 seconds. Targets never appear on the edges of screens.
